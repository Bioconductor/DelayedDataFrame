5/11/2018, review code with Herve & Daniel:

## DelayedDataFrame code polish. 
- stand-alone package? convenient. 
- check colnames for DDF construction. 
- extractCOLS...  (forked from S4Vectors to Liubuntu, will test)

## think of SimpleList as rectangular!

## bugs in pkg: methods
package attributes stripped with [[, and as.list()

## further implementation in S4Vectors
acbind/arbind

## future new features to implement 
- Michaels comments: https://github.com/Bioconductor/VariantExperiment/issues/3#issuecomment-387192874
- Herve: SNPlocks, Gpos? on-disk long table? SQL...
- relational/algebra? DataFrame S4 replacement or ordinary data.frame.
