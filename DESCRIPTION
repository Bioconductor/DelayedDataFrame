Description: Based on the standard DataFrame metaphor, we are trying
    to implement the feature of delayed operation on the
    DelayedDataFrame, with a slot of lazyIndex, which saves the
    mapping indexes for each column of DelayedDataFrame. Methods like
    show, validity check, [/[[ subsetting, rbind/cbind are implemented
    for DelayedDataFrame to be operated around lazyIndex. The listData
    slot stays untouched until a realization call e.g., DataFrame
    constructor OR as.list() is invoked.
