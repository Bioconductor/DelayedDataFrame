Description: Based on the standard DataFrame metaphor, we are trying to implement the feature of delayed operation on the DelayedDataFrame, with a slot of lazyIndex, which saves the mapping indexes for each column of DelayedDataFrame. Methods like show, validity check, [/[[ subsetting, rbind/cbind are implemented for DelayedDataFrame to be operated around lazyIndex. The listData slot stays untouched until a realization call e.g., DataFrame constructor OR as.list() incurred.
